      "text": "Expand the Organic Farming Techniques page (frontend/src/pages/Techniques.tsx) to include at least 9 additional techniques beyond the existing three (Composting, Pest Control, Crop Rotation). Add the following new techniques: (1) Green Manuring 🌿, (2) Mulching 🍂, (3) Vermicomposting 🪱, (4) Drip Irrigation 💧, (5) Intercropping 🌾, (6) Biological Pest Control 🐞, (7) Soil pH Management 🧪, (8) Rainwater Harvesting 🌧️, and (9) Seed Treatment & Selection 🌱. Each technique card must display: an emoji icon, the technique name, a 2–3 sentence overview description, a step-by-step process section (3–5 numbered steps), a key benefits list (at least 3 bullet points), a recommended tools/inputs section listing 2–4 relevant tools or materials, and a pro tip or best practice callout. The existing three technique cards (Composting, Pest Control, Crop Rotation) must also be updated to include the same enriched structure (step-by-step process, benefits list, recommended tools, pro tip) if not already present. All cards must be displayed in a responsive grid layout and animated with slideUp on scroll entry using the existing AnimatedSection component. The existing 'Explore Categories' CTA button must remain intact at the bottom of the page.",
