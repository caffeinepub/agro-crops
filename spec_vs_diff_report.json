  "summary": "The diff shows that frontend/src/pages/Techniques.tsx was significantly expanded and frontend/src/utils/translations.ts was updated. The implementation appears to address REQ-50 by adding new technique cards with enriched structure, updating the translations file, and preserving the existing layout. However, due to truncation of the Techniques.tsx diff, full verification of all 12 cards and all required fields cannot be confirmed with certainty. Based on the visible evidence, the core requirements appear to be met.",

This interactive expand/collapse behavior was not requested in REQ-50, which only asked for cards displaying all content sections without specifying they should be hidden behind a toggle.",
