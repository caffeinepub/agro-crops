  "summary": "The diff implements multi-language support (English, Hindi, Marathi) with a LanguageContext, translations file, LanguageSwitcher component, and integration across multiple page components. The core infrastructure (REQ-29, REQ-30, REQ-31) appears well implemented. REQ-32 is partially implemented — several pages (Home, About, Techniques, Farm, Shop, Header, Footer) show t(key) usage, but Cattle, Equipment, Contact, GovernmentSchemes, Signup, and OtpVerification pages are not shown in the diff, leaving their translation coverage unverifiable. Some hardcoded English strings remain in pages that were modified (e.g., 'Organic Cultivation', '100% Organic & Sustainable', 'Organic Products' badge labels, organicBenefits array in Farm.tsx). The Footer also has a hardcoded English description string.",
