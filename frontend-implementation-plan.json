Enrich all 12 technique objects (3 existing + 9 new) with the following structure: emoji icon, technique name, 2–3 sentence overview description, step-by-step process array (3–5 numbered steps), key benefits array (at least 3 bullet points), recommended tools/inputs array (2–4 items), and a pro tip or best practice callout string. Update the technique card rendering logic to display all these new fields in a structured layout within each card. Ensure the responsive grid layout uses Tailwind classes for 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, and 3 on desktop. Wrap each technique card with the existing AnimatedSection component using the slideUp animation. Preserve the existing 'Explore Categories' CTA button at the bottom of the page. Maintain all existing multilingual support via the LanguageContext translation function."
