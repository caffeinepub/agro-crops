# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Expand the Organic Farming Techniques page with 9 additional techniques and enrich all existing technique cards with deeper structured content.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 9 new technique cards to the Techniques page: Green Manuring 🌿, Mulching 🍂, Vermicomposting 🪱, Drip Irrigation 💧, Intercropping 🌾, Biological Pest Control 🐞, Soil pH Management 🧪, Rainwater Harvesting 🌧️, and Seed Treatment & Selection 🌱
- Update the 3 existing technique cards (Composting, Pest Control, Crop Rotation) with enriched content structure
- Each technique card (new and existing) must display: emoji icon, technique name, 2–3 sentence overview, step-by-step process (3–5 numbered steps), key benefits list (≥3 bullet points), recommended tools/inputs (2–4 items), and a pro tip callout
- Display all cards in a responsive grid (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
- Wrap each card with the existing AnimatedSection component for slideUp scroll-entry animation
- Keep the existing "Explore Categories" CTA button at the bottom of the page

**User-visible outcome:** Users visiting the Organic Farming Techniques page will see 12 richly detailed technique cards with step-by-step guidance, benefits, tools, and pro tips, all presented in an animated responsive grid layout.
