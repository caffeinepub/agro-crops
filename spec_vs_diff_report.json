  "summary": "Both REQ-23 and REQ-24 are largely implemented. The GovernmentSchemes page is created with 6 scheme cards, AnimatedSection usage, green gradient header, and the /schemes route is registered under the authenticated mainRoute. The Header includes a Customer Details form with Full Name, Address, Phone fields, validation, success message, and cart clearing. One minor AC item for REQ-24 regarding authentication-only access appears satisfied via the mainRoute guard. The nav link label uses 'Schemes' instead of 'Government Schemes' which is a minor deviation but functionally correct. No significant hallucinated features were found.",

      "requirement": "A 'Government Schemes' navigation link is added to the Header navigation bar (the label should be 'Government Schemes' per spec)",
