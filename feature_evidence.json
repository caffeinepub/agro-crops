Below the list of cart items, render a form with fields for: Full Name, Delivery Address (textarea), and Phone Number. The form should only be visible when the cart has at least one item. Include a 'Proceed to Checkout' button at the bottom that validates all three fields are filled before submitting. On successful validation, show a success confirmation message (e.g., 'Order placed successfully! We will contact you shortly.') and clear the cart.
